## Setup
You will need to set up a `.env` file.  If you're using this as a discord bot, you only need to configure the `DISCORD_TOKEN` value.
You can read about creating a [Bot Account Here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)

You will also need to install python packages.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage
Once you've added the bot to your discord server, you can simply type `!pickspot` and the bot will return a location from the dictionary.
